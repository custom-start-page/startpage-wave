1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm start` to locally host the website
1. Navigate to the URL which your terminal prints out to view your startpage

## Hosting

This startpage needs to be hosted by a web server in order to work.

It's already hosted at https://wave.customstart.page for your convenience.

### Self host

If you want to self host, you can use https://github.com/custom-start-page/custom-start-page-tool/ to run the server.

## Packaging

Run:

```
dist.sh
```

This will create a `/dist` folder which can be zipped and released.
